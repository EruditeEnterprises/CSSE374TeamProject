Design and build a simple tool to generate the most essential elements of the UML class diagram for arbitrary Java code: classes, methods, instance variables, and inheritance/implements arrows. While there are lots of tools that will generate this level of UML for you, you will later be augmenting the graph with more sophisticated analysis of the design than standard tools provide. For this reason, it will be key to use good design principles.
